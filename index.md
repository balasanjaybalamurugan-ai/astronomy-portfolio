## About This Site

This portfolio documents my journey through the cosmos, featuring detailed observations of celestial phenomena, astrophotography, and educational resources for fellow astronomy enthusiasts. Here you'll find comprehensive data on stellar classifications, planetary observations, and deep-sky object cataloging.

My work focuses on several key areas:
- **Stellar Photometry**: Precise measurements of star brightness and variability
- **Planetary Imaging**: High-resolution captures of planetary surfaces and atmospheric features
- **Deep Sky Photography**: Long-exposure imaging of galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters
- **Spectroscopy**: Analysis of light spectra to determine chemical composition of celestial objects
